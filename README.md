*WHERE THE BLEEP*

&copy; James Mahan & General Assembly, WDI-57. 

Do you hate when you make plans with your friends and there's that _one_ person who's never ever on time? Wouldn't it be great to be able to track your friends and get real-time updates about how close they _really_ are to getting to dinner/your meetup/where you are

**Where The Bleep** was born out of that frustration.  

A user creates an event to let their friends know about something fun coming up. That user can then invite their friends to join the event. 

Please note: **WTBAY** is sensitive to the security of its user's privacy and flat-out states: data is not being sold to the highest bidder. A user has to opt-in to using the service. This isn't Cambridge Analytica; this is merely a tool intended to help you plan your life.


Here's the signup page:

Once a user signs up and opts in to being tracked, they are geolocated by their web browser.

A user can then look at scheduled upcoming events and join any event they might be interested in.

After being geolocated, that user can broadcast their location to other parties interested in that event. All connected users can then track each other in real time, thereby increasing accountability and letting people know where the <bleep> their friends actually are.

The user will always know if they are being tracked, based upon the message at the bottom of the navigation bar: it either says "not currently tracking any events" or "currently tracking people attending..."

Once a user has reached the destination (or decides they no longer want to broadcast their location to anyone), the user just has to log out and their location will no longer be broadcast.

*Technologies Used:* 
This browser app was built using React, Express,  MongoDB, socket.io, the Google Maps API, HTML, CSS, a bit of Bootstrap, and a couple of Google's best fonts. Huge, huge props to my instructors and WDI family.

The wireframes can be viewed at  [James' Trello Page](https://trello.com/b/RDHfQP3p/where-the-bleep-are-you). 

*Getting Started:*
The app can be found at [where-the-bleep.heroku.com](https://hikingwithfriends.herokuapp.com/). 

*Next Steps:*
In the coming months, I'm hoping to allow a user to automatically log out once they arrive at a location.
